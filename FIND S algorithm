Implement and demonstrate the FIND-S algorithm for finding the most specific hypothesis based on a given set of training data samples. Read the training data from a .CSV file.

#importing all the required library files
import pandas as pd 
import numpy as np 

#loading data set file
data = pd.read_csv('play.csv')

#extracting the values as concepts and target
concepts = np.array(data)[:,:-1] 
target = np.array(data)[:,-1]
